# Picard

Picard is a software that allows to connect hardware instrument panels with
Microsoft Flight Simulator using SimConnect. The purpose of Picard is to provide
a seamless integration between physical instrument panels and the flight
simulator, allowing pilots to have a more realistic and immersive experience.
The software is written in Rust and uses a multithreaded architecture to mediate
between the simulator and multiple hardware panels using serial connections.
